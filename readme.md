# Phonebook REST API

An Express.js-based phonebook API with user authentication, CRUD operations for contacts, utilizing Jest for unit testing, and supporting avatar updates via multipart form-data.

## Structure:
- **/controllers** - Handles requests, interacts with models, and sends responses.
- **/helpers** - Contains utility/helper functions used across different parts of the application, aiding in various functionalities.
- **/middlewares** - Contains middleware functions (e.g., authentication middleware).
- **/models** - Defines database schemas and interacts with the database.
- **/public** - Serves as a temporary storage directory for user avatars before they're uploaded to the database. It temporarily holds user avatar images during the upload process.
- **/routes** - Defines API endpoints and routes.
- **/tmp** - Another temporary storage directory used by the application for file uploads or other transient data. It may also be utilized for handling temporary data or file manipulation before final processing or storage.
- **/utils** - Contains various utility functions or modules that provide generic functionalities throughout the application.
- **Dockerfile** - Configuration file containing instructions for building a Docker image for the application.
- **app.js** - Entry point of the application, sets up server and middleware.
- **env.example** - Example file showing the structure and keys of environment variables required by the application.
- **nodemon.json** - Configuration file for Nodemon, a utility that monitors changes in the application and automatically restarts the server during development.
- **package.json** - Contains project metadata and dependencies.
- **README.md** - Provides instructions for setting up and running the application.
- **server.js** - Server setup file, handling server configurations or starting the application.

## Functionality:

### Authentication:
- User registration, login, and logout endpoints.
